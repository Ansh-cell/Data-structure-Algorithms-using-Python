    "## First lets discuss why we need object-oriented programming ?\n",
    "##### <i>1. It's a very useful way of doing programming while doing some kind of development, and it's a default way of doing programming.</i>\n",
    "##### <i>2. We want our code should be very similar to the way we communicate with others in real life</i>\n",
    "##### <i>3. So we basically talk in object-oriented way like hey Asayhem can you pass me that water-bottle.<br> So here i am telling Asayhem (which I consider an object) to pass water-bottle (object) where you need to do something about another object. </i>\n",
    "##### <i>so our code look something like this: Asayhem.pass_me(water-bottle)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so when you look at this line you know what this will do right ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here Asayhem --> object & pass_me --> looks like a function which take an argument\n",
    "## Let's look at some words you will encounter when learning Object-oriented programming.\n",
    "##### <i>1. class: what is that ? --> It's just a template on how are my objects looks like.</i><br><i>2.object: it has some functionality which are able to do some work for us. They also have some attributes (data) like pass_me, give_me, play_with_me these are functions and water-bottle, pen, football these are data."
